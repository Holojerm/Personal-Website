                <h3>Biography:</h3>
                <h5>&emsp;In 1920, Dr. Franklin was born the second child to Ellis Arthur Franklin and Muriel Frances Waley.  By the time she went to college, she had received a scholarship to attend Newnham College.  After Newnham, she went to Cambridge University.  While there, she became an Assistant Research Officer at British Coal Utilisation Research Association.  After receiving her doctorate, she took a position in Paris at the 'Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'Etat'.
                    <br> &emsp;Later, she obtained a fellowship to work at King's College in London.  There, she found that DNA 'B' is helical in structure, leading to finding that both forms of DNA are comprised of two helical structures via Photograph 51.  In 1955, at Birkbeck College, she published her findings on the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a single stranded RNA virus. She also discovered the position and structure of RNA in TMV.  In 1958, she passed away before her time due to abdominal cancer.</h5>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Her devotion to research showed itself at its finest in the last months of her life. Although stricken with an illness which she knew would be fatal, she continued to work right up to the end.</p>
